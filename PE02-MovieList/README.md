# Input
The program takes a predefined list of movies as input. Each movie includes a title, genre, and release year. The user interacts with the program by selecting a genre from a dropdown menu or clicking on a movie card.

# Process
When the user selects a genre, the program filters the movies list based on the selected genre. It uses Reactâ€™s `useState` to manage the selected genre and dynamically updates the displayed movies. Clicking on a movie triggers an alert showing the movie title.

# Output
The program displays the list of movies as cards, showing the title, genre, and release year. If "All Genres" is selected, all movies are shown. When a movie is clicked, an alert appears with the movie's title. This output provides an interactive way to explore movies based on genres.
