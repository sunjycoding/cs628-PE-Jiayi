# Input
This program does not accept dynamic user input. All the information, such as the name, contact details, education background, and project descriptions, is pre-defined in the `Resume.js` file. These hardcoded details are used to create a static resume webpage.

# Process
The program is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The `Resume.js` file defines the structure and content of the resume as a functional component. The `Resume.css` file is used to style the resume, giving it a professional appearance. The `App.js` file integrates the `Resume` component into the overall application, making it displayable in a browser. React processes the component and renders it efficiently.

# Output
The program outputs a visually appealing resume displayed in a browser. It includes sections for contact details, education, and projects. The design is simple yet professional, and users can view it as a static webpage without needing to interact or input any data.
