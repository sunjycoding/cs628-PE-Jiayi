# Input
The application starts with a default city list. The user can add a new city by entering its name, country, and population in a text box and clicking the "Add City" button.

# Process
When the user enters the city details and clicks "Add City," the city is added to the list. The program uses Reactâ€™s useState to manage the list of cities and user input. After adding a city, the user is automatically redirected to the cities list. Each city name in the list is a clickable link that takes the user to a details page showing more information about the city.

# Output
The program displays the list of cities as clickable items. When a user clicks on a city name, the program shows the city's details, including its country and population. The app provides a structured and simple way to view and add cities, making it easy for users to navigate between pages and see relevant information.
